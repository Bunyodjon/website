                 This is a Shiny app that visualizes State of the Union(SOTU) addresses of last three president of America. 
                     The first tab of the app allows users to see differences between presedential speeches using comparison clouds.
                     The second tab allows users to see association of SOTU speeches with the NRC lexicon which is ten basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, disgust, negative and positive).
                     Third tab allows users to view sentiment score of speeches from the beginning till the end of a speech, and compre how sentiment score differs between speeches and from sentence to sentence.

                Accidents, such as vehicle crashes, are said to be the fourth leading cause of death in the United States and the 
                leading cause of death for individuals ages 1-44 (Medical News Today, 2017). The number of car accidents is especially
                high in the United States because driving oneself is the most common form of transportation used by Americans.

                <br>
                This is a group project that I led last semester. I was responsbile for writing the Shiny App and making it online. I was very happy with 
                the result we achieved because this app gave us a good understanding of fatal accidents. This app utilizes data 
                from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA); an organization that studies vehicle safety and driving 
                behavior to reduce vehicle crashes (United States Department of Transportation, 2018). Establishing a broader 
                understanding of when and where fatal accidents occur across the state of Ohio can lead to greater awareness of this
                phenomenon. R Code could be found <a href="https://github.com/Bunyodjon/data-viz-fatal-car-accidents-ohio">here</a>.

                 This project tries to visualize fruit and vegetables consumption in East Cost states, and find explanation why 
                 fruit and vegetables consumption is high or low some states compare to others. After searching around for while, I found that 
                availability of fruits & vegetables, having access to stores and ability to purchase affects daily fruit and vegetable 
                consumption. I am certain that there are other factors that effects fruit&vegetable consumption. If you know something interesting 
                about this, please let me know. Your feedback is always welcomed here!

               <h4><a href="https://github.com/Bunyodjon/biostatistics-article-review-R/blob/master/final_project_review.pdf">Review of a Biostatistics Article</a></h4>
               This project is a report of a recent article in biomedical study that uses several statistical methods. 
               The paper I selected examines the association between muscle weakness, as measured by handgrip strength, and mortality 
               of elderly people. The paper is based on 9-year observational study from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) which is
               the longest running longitudinal study of older Americans in the United States. The goal of the report is to replicate the article,  
               critique the methods and conduct the analysis using a different approach. In order to get data for the article, I opened an account in HRS site and downloaded data. I found HRS database little complicated and 
               I had to preprocess the data before running the final tests. My results are a little off from the original results but it gives a 
               similar result.
