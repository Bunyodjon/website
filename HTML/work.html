                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                 My professional interests include statistics, data science, education, startups, and investments.              
                 I am currently looking for a job in statistics or data science as I will be graduating in May 2019. 
                 <br><br>
                 Last summer I worked at Atria Senior Living as a Data Science intern and I have been lucky to be a part of a great Data Science. 
                 After the internship, I was 100% certain that I love working in this area and solving business chellenges. My interests and excitment 
                 towards statistics and data science have grown more after taking Data Visualization and Machine Learning classes. 
                 <br><br>  
                 My interests within data science are machine learning, NLP, working with text data and cultivate insights, active learning methods.
                 Previously, I was a mathematics faculty member at the University of Central Asia. I really enjoyed my experience as a teacher. Through teaching, I learned how to 
                 explain complicated concepts using visualization and videos. Also, teaching taught me how to present, communicate and answer questions in front of a group of people.
