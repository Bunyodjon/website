                 Hi, I'm Bunyod!
                   <br>  
                   <br>
                     I am a senior graduate student in Statistics at Miami University with a strong interest in data science. I love working with data and getting useful insights.
                     This website includes some of my projects in Data Visualization, Machine Leaning and Active Leaning with text data.    
                   <br>
                   <br>
                     With a passion for statistics and programming, I love solving business challenges with the help of data and statistics. 
                     Over the course of my professional experience I have worked in diverse environments and successfully completed independent 
                     and team-based projects using my three key ingredients: knowledge, teamwork and communication. I really enjoy working on 
                     challenging projects and improve my skills in R, Python, SAS and SQL.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                     Besides data science and statistics, I have passion for sports, cooking dishes from different countries, and contributing to higher education. 
                     I am always open for working on new projects and contribute as much as I can.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     Please feel free to browsing through my projects and CV. If you have a suggestion or a project you would like to discuss,
                     please feel free to contact me. Thank you for visiting my site!
